IBM Nao. How to use.

Software requirements.
This was the software we used when developing our robot. Some were older versions
at time of development, we did this intentionally as we ran into problems when using
newer versions.

1. Python 2.7 *32-bit*. This is for the NaoQi SDK to communicate with your robot.
2. V-Rep PRO EDU, Version 3.6.2 64-bit.
3. Choregraphe version 2.1.4.13
4. Any Python IDE of your choice. 
5. NaoQi Python SDK. 32-bit.

How to use:
1. Launch V-Rep and open the scene myNAO.ttt in the Vrep scene folder. 
2. Launch Choregraphe and connect to a virtual bot. Make sure you get the port number of your virtual bot.
3. Open the Scripts folder as a project in a IDE of your choice.
	3.1 Run single-nao-control.py. Use the correct port numbers of your robots. Once you see
	"Choregraphe connected to V-Rep" then you're good to go.
	3.2 Now, you want the robot in V-Rep to initially match the robot in Choregraphe. Since
	the robot in V-Rep is initially sitting down, the robot in Choregraphe must also be sitting down.
	Make sure the robot in Choregraphe is sitting down before you continue to the next step.
	3.3 Start the V-Rep simulation by clicking the play button.
	3.4 Finally, run MSTT.py
	
The program will start listening. To wake it and make it stand up, you must greet
it with "Hello", "Hi" or "Hey". Then ask for the category you would like. The robot
should then point you in the right direction and say which shelf you should go to.
And that's it. To change the flow of the interaction, edit the main.py file.
